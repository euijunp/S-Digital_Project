        "content": "The Scotsman\n\n Thu 22 Aug 2002 \n\n Meaningful sentences \n \n Tracey Lawson \n \n \n If you ever wanted to look like \"one of the most dangerous inmates in prison\n history\", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\n muscle power. \n \n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\n virtually no cost. \n \n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\n exercise industry. \n \n \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"Its a joke and a big con and they call\n me a criminal!\" You cant help feeling he has a point. \n \n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. \n \n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n award-winning film. \n \n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n critical praise. \n \n And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt\n scribbling away as we speak. \n \n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n pragmatic and profound. \n \n He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \n \n \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \n \n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n the very essence of who they are. \n \n \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n good?\" \n \n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\n two days during a jail siege. \n \n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \n \n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \n \n \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\n described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\n its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\n your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me.\" \n \n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\n we all needed. \n \n \n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\n be available in bookstores from October at 7.99\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
