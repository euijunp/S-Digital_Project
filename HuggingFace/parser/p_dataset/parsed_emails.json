If this is \nerroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time \nmailing, so no removal is necessary.\n\nIf you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, \nMLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that \nhas ever landed in your Inbox.\n\nMULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE\n\nMLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit \nof the \"MLM Dream\" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, \ntheir fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally \nflawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.\n\nThe companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to \ntell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to \ncut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.\n\nHERE'S GOOD NEWS\n\nThere IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet \nabandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income \nyou've dreamed about is easier than you think!\n\nWith your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you \nWHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to \nsomething so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of \nthis before.\n\nI promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one \nwill call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the \ninformation. Period.\n\nTo receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type \n\"Send Info\" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you \nwithin 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.\n\nCordially,\n\nSiddhi\n\nP.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most \neye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I \nhonestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And \nit's FREE!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis email is NEVER sent unsolicited.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>\nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\n<BR>\nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>\nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>\nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>\n<BR>\n\"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>\ndime.\"<BR>\n<BR>\nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>\nproportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>\nbetween </FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#0000A0\"> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<BR>\nJudgment debt</FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#000000\">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>\nJudgments take its place.<BR>\n<BR>\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>\ntechniques necessary to succeed.<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>\nprocessing of Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#0000A0\"> We<BR>\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>\nand $100,000.00 per year </FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#000000\"> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>\ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n</FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#0000A0\"> 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>\nare women and 36% are part time</FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#000000\">  .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>\n<BR>\nQuote's from several of our students:<BR>\n<BR>\nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop<BR>\nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#0000A0\"> My<BR>\nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#000000\">  .

I<BR>\nhave added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>\nyour course for 5 months\"<BR>\n<BR>\n>From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>\nwhy we can state the following:<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>\nA business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>\nwhich could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>\nretire on and travel the world.

Texas-based \nCommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock \nChina's amazing potential.\n\nINVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY\n\nTexas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) \nannounces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to \nChina in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of\nhigh pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor\nof its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:\nthey captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and\nyou can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW \nmay make company history.\n\nOpening China's Door\n\nUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, \nCMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of \nentrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to \ndo business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for \nexample, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say \"goodbye\" to \nthe layers of middlemen.\n\nCMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler \n\nCMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This\nis an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest\nfortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential\nis being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.\n\nCMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... \nsky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of \na growth company. \n\n*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** \n\nObviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US \ncompanies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. \nBut you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth \npotential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start \nof the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. \n\nThere's much more to the CMNW story.

I am now receiving less BOMBS when I am on-line;therefore, I believe it is better than the last version.There is, though, one little agonizing message \"Image Toolbar\"that pops up every time you pass the mouse over an image.It asks whether you want to save or print the image. UGH,what a pest.Hurrah, you can get rid of the Image Toolbar. Justperform a Right Mouse Click over the Image Toolbar.It will allow you to disable the Image Toolbar forthis session or forever. If you want to re-establishthe Image Toolbar just go to the Internet OptionsControl Panel and you can turn the Image Toolbar back on.Remember, a right mouse click over any Windows Icon,Window, tool bar, the Desktop, and most other Windowsentities will list loads of information.

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too!

This is the letter you \nhave been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of \nthis letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted \nan entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see \nif it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or \nnot the program was legal. \n\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws \nprohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the \nsimple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \n$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF \nPOPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, \nIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \n\nThis is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I \nwas approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am \nso gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the \nminimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ \n610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\" \nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \n\n=================================================== \n\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long \ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again \nin the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple \ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. \nFirst month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made \na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the \nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \nanything.''

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN \nADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail \nproblems. \n\n=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. \nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer \nand resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. \n\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from \nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be \naccessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them \nfrom you.

Once you understand the way this works, you will also see \nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been \ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!!

Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE \nSURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! \n\n========================================================== \n\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your \ncomputer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. \nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with \nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide \nyou with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk \ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. \nThere are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: \nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n\n==========================================================\n \nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will \nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's \nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response \ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people \nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). \nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% \nresponse, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded \nby sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 \ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and \nordered Report # 2\n. \nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. \nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails \nsent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n \nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 \n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report \n# 5\n THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).\n \nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 \n... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 \n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT \nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !\n \n========================================================= \n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE \nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. \nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even \none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are \nover 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, \nmany people will do just that, and more! \nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n\n======================================================= \n\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds \nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will \neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 \nand dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you \nmust do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide \nsame day service on all orders. \nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and \naddress on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they \nreceivethe report. \n\n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== \n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: \nAlways send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT \naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets \nof paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME \nof the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name \nand postal address. \n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \n\n==================================================== \n\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\" \nOrder Report #1 from: \n\n A.

Ebert\nR. R. #4\nThamesford, Ontario, Canada\nN0M 2M0\n\n____________________________________________________________ \n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ \n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success: \n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 \nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. \n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you \nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2.

I am an \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. \nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk \nmail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population \nand percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored \nmy supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I \nmade merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on \nher when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks \nshe had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received \ntotal $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody \nin her ''hobby''. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois \n\n====================================================== \n\n''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my \nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that \nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I \nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was \nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with \norders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about \nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a \nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\" \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n\n======================================================= \n\n''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered \nif I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to \nget another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone \nelse.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not \ndelete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the \nmoney came within 22 weeks.\" \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \n\n======================================================= \n\n''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and \nwithin 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made \n$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was \n$362,840.00.

I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and <BR>\na change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, <BR>\nI only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7.

GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <BR>\nsimilar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <BR>\nhours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones <BR>\nsecreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <BR>\nthe body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR>\n<BR>\nEvery three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <BR>\nThe body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <BR>\ndying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original <BR>\ncells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <BR>\nstore memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability <BR>\nto learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR>\n<BR>\nGrowth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <BR>\nWhen growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <BR>\nall-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance <BR>\nwhich is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <BR>\nproper dosage amounts. <BR>\n<BR>\nGH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <BR>\nmelatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny <BR>\nchemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <BR>\nthe activities of the vital organs. The word \"hormone\" is derived from a Greek word <BR>\nmeaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <BR>\neffects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other <BR>\nhormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <BR>\nreverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <BR>\nmaking the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <BR>\nhelps restore hair color and hair loss. <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B> <BR>\nTHE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B>  <BR>\n<BR>\nOur bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production <BR>\ngradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <BR>\ndecade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, <BR>\nits availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians <BR>\nhave been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <BR>\nUnfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical <BR>\nprofession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been <BR>\nthat the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <BR>\neffective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by <BR>\nAnti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B> <BR>\nGH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B>  <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT face=\"MS Sans Serif\">\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B> <BR>\nGrowth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <BR>\nThe amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <BR>\nThis results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <BR>\nof 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <BR>\n200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages <BR>\nof 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, <BR>\nor Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called <BR>\naging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <BR>\nHealing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <BR>\nThose who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <BR>\nan effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.</B></FONT>\n<FONT face=\"Times New Roman\">\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B>  <BR>\n<BR>\nAfter numerous clinical studies, the following was determined <BR>\nafter 6 or more months of GH therapy: <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#FFFF00\"><B> _ Improved memory <BR>\n_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs <BR>\n_ Increased sexual drive and performance <BR>\n_ Increased fertility <BR>\n_ Enhanced immune system <BR>\n_ Quicker wound and fracture healing <BR>\n_ New hair growth and color reparation <BR>\n_ Sharper vision <BR>\n_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance <BR>\n_ Increased muscle mass without exercise <BR>\n_ Reduction of cellulite and fat <BR>\n_ Increased stamina and vitality <BR>\n_ Reduction in high blood pressure <BR>\n_ Improvement in sleep <BR>\n_ Anti-aging <BR>\n_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing <BR>\n_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol <BR>\n_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol <BR>\n_ Strengthening of bones <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FFFF00\"><B> <BR>\n</B></FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B> IS GH SAFE?</B></FONT>\n<FONT size=3>\n<FONT color=\"#FF0000\"><B>  </B></FONT>\n<FONT color=\"#00FF00\"><B> <BR>\nGH has been successfully used in the medical community <BR>\nfor over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. <BR>\nEdmond Klein, M.D. and L.

Also in the second or third \nparagraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as \nshown on the page.<p>\n\nI feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should \nbe displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered \non the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>\n\nAs has been mentioned many times, some information about the person \ndoing the page is always good.  We need some information about \nwhy this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nDennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations \nfor improving your page.<br>\n1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to \n'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading \nfor all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like \nyou were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>\n2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you \nto spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend \nlook it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>\n3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like \nbefore they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you \ntheir email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know \nthey can unsubscribe.<br>\n4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. \nIt looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>\n5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your \nnewsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or \nan archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>\n6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that \npage. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nI feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. \nI also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read \nquickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. \nI noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds \nsite should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. \nA site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nThis is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the \nmessage.

(Issue #422) <p>\n\n--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is \nblocking 50% of \nthe web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by \nusing a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is \nthere a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>\n<p>\nA proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. \nI have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then \nfrom there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that \nblock content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money \nwith them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and \nbecause they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>\n\nI have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=\"http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php\"> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>\nSee there for more info.

Also in the second or third \nparagraph is a misspelled word which should be \"first-come\" not as \nshown on the page.<p>\n\nI feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should \nbe displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered \non the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>\n\nAs has been mentioned many times, some information about the person \ndoing the page is always good.  We need some information about \nwhy this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nDennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations \nfor improving your page.<br>\n1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to \n'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading \nfor all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like \nyou were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>\n2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you \nto spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend \nlook it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>\n3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like \nbefore they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you \ntheir email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know \nthey can unsubscribe.<br>\n4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. \nIt looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>\n5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your \nnewsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or \nan archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>\n6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that \npage. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nI feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. \nI also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read \nquickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. \nI noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds \nsite should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. \nA site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>\n~~~~<p>\n\nThis is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the \nmessage.  I did not like the background colour, however that is \npersonal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted \nto sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see \na current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word \nmissed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be \nsmaller.

ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they\n<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to\n<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.\n<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do\n<br>not produce results.\n<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.\n<br>Poor sales letters.\n<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?\n<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into\n<br>your sales letter...\n<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.\n<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your\n<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your\n<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter\n<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?\n<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will\n<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.\n<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going\n<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your\n<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is\n<br>going to read them.\n<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my\n<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on\n<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must\n<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our\n<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily\n<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback\n<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how\n<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively\n<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home\n<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you\n<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an\n<br>account from the \"real world.\"&nbsp; It effectively creates\n<br>interest and further establishes the point.\n<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first\n<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should\n<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know\n<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first\n<br>words were, \"It's true.\"&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either\n<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\"\n<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking\n<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8\n<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first\n<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,\n<br>you've got a winner.\n<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted\n<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use\n<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or\n<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.\n<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight\n<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.\n<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after\n<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet\n<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.\n<br>Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most\n<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a\n<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically\n<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad\n<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the\n<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to\n<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service\n<br>will aid them.\n<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that\n<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You\n<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing\n<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it\n<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much\n<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read\n<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to\n<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all\n<br>of your ideas.\n<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the\n<br>words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\"\n<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not\n<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,\n<br>but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about\n<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"&nbsp; Leads aren't\n<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in\n<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished\n<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test\n<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see\n<br>what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to\n<br>\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's\n<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.\n<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that\n<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters\n<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.\n<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\"\n<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.\n<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great\n<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest\n<br>Hemingway.\n<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.\n<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short\n<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be\n<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.\n<p>Or this.\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of\n<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often\n<br>force the reader to get distracted.\n<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,\n<br>readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it\n<br>for&nbsp; me?\"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it\n<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be\n<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't\n<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but\n<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your\n<br>reader.\n<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may\n<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,\n<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I\n<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while\n<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,\n<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe\n<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not\n<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress\n<br>the benefits, not the features.\n<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read\n<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can\n<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are\n<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to\n<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted\n<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers\n<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language\n<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.\n<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with\n<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a\n<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a \"work\n<br>at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding\n<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards\n<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales\n<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another\n<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be\n<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income\n<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.\n<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in\n<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service\n<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only\n<br>5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only\n<br>5 hours a week.\"&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload\n<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website\n<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).\n<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted\n<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the \"College Students\" page\n<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be\n<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.\n<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally\n<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product\n<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a\n<br>match made for them.\n<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences\n<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention\n<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One\n<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales\n<br>letters...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.\n<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting\n<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,\n<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on\n<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook\n<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's\n<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK\n<br>HERE to continue.\"\n<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the\n<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood\n<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\"\n<br>If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat\n<br>that let the mouse get away.\"&nbsp; Use words to create a picture\n<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what\n<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster\n<br>than a speeding bullet.\"&nbsp; \"More powerful than a locomotive.\"\n<br>\"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how\n<br>word pictures stick in our minds?\n<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell\n<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only\n<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one\n<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and\n<br>services as back-end products.\n<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are\n<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the\n<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the\n<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must\n<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is\n<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.\n<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the\n<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of \"You won't find\n<br>this anywhere else.\"\n<p>17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\"\n<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or\n<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that\n<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.\n<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be\n<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will\n<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you\n<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available\n<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they\n<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.\n<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.\n<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but\n<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing\n<br>weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing\n<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's\n<br>mind.&nbsp; \"What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?\"\n<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to\n<br>think, \"This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what\n<br>I can expect.\"&nbsp; \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the\n<br>human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude\n<br>Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They\n<br>leave no impression whatsoever.\"\n<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would\n<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of\n<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before\n<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.\n<br>Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"&nbsp; Then, address that\n<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the\n<br>reader from making the purchase.\n<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual\n<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about\n<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire\n<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and\n<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the\n<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; \"If these people have\n<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I\n<br>probably will too.\"&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials\n<br>from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target\n<br>field.\n<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.\n<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your\n<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-\n<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings\n<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next\n<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on\n<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are\n<br>that important.\n<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; \"Wouldn't you like to\n<br>make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would\n<br>you like to be as successful as I am?\"&nbsp; Avoid any question\n<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them\n<br>feel like they are inferior.\n<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.\n<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a\n<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try\n<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free\n<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to\n<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up\n<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.\n<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having\n<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.\n<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful\n<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they\n<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.\n<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things\n<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters\n<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product\n<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were\n<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial\n<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table\n<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality\n<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages\n<br>the credibility of your main offer.\n<p>25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\"\n<br>and \"But that's not all.\"&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead\n<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly\n<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or\n<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE\n<br>value and benefits to the reader.\n<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,\n<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.\n<br>\"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the\n<br>bonuses.\"&nbsp; \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,\n<br>I've got to hurry.\"&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will\n<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,\n<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will\n<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines\n<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.\n<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the\n<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell\n<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,\n<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.\n<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.\n<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How\n<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be\n<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can\n<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you\n<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a\n<br>system in place.&nbsp; \"Operators are standing by.\"&nbsp; Their order\n<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.\n<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last\n<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day\n<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most\n<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give\n<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the\n<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make\n<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your\n<br>product or service RISK-FREE.\n<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people\n<br>just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"&nbsp; \"Order today!\"\n<br>\"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"&nbsp; You've got them\n<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them\n<br>to \"Act Fast!\"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial\n<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right\n<br>way?\n<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the\n<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT\n<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the\n<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the\n<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A\n<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they\n<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed\n<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use\n<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.\n<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe\n<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use\n<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer\n<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would\n<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.\n<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see\n<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you\n<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be\n<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they\n<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to\n<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.\n<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do\n<br>not produce results.\n<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.\n<br>Poor sales letters.\n<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?\n<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into\n<br>your sales letter...\n<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.\n<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your\n<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your\n<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter\n<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?\n<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will\n<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.\n<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going\n<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your\n<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is\n<br>going to read them.\n<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my\n<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on\n<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must\n<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our\n<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily\n<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback\n<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how\n<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively\n<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home\n<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you\n<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an\n<br>account from the \"real world.\"&nbsp; It effectively creates\n<br>interest and further establishes the point.\n<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first\n<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should\n<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know\n<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first\n<br>words were, \"It's true.\"&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either\n<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought \"What's true?\"\n<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking\n<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8\n<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first\n<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,\n<br>you've got a winner.\n<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted\n<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use\n<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or\n<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.\n<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight\n<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.\n<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after\n<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet\n<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.\n<br>Pull out the big guns and stress \"just a few of\" the most\n<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a\n<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically\n<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad\n<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the\n<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to\n<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service\n<br>will aid them.\n<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that\n<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You\n<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing\n<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it\n<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much\n<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read\n<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to\n<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all\n<br>of your ideas.\n<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the\n<br>words \"you\" and \"your\" are at least 4:1 over \"I\" and \"my.\"\n<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not\n<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,\n<br>but it's something like this, \"I don't care a thing about\n<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.\"&nbsp; Leads aren't\n<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in\n<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished\n<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test\n<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see\n<br>what the ratio between \"you\" and \"your\" versus references to\n<br>\"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's\n<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.\n<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that\n<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters\n<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.\n<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with \"And\" or \"Because.\"\n<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.\n<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great\n<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest\n<br>Hemingway.\n<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.\n<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short\n<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be\n<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.\n<p>Or this.\n<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of\n<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often\n<br>force the reader to get distracted.\n<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,\n<br>readers want the burning question answered, \"What's in it\n<br>for&nbsp; me?\"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it\n<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be\n<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't\n<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but\n<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your\n<br>reader.\n<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may\n<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,\n<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I\n<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while\n<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,\n<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe\n<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not\n<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress\n<br>the benefits, not the features.\n<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read\n<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can\n<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are\n<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to\n<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted\n<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers\n<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language\n<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.\n<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with\n<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a\n<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a \"work\n<br>at home\" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding\n<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards\n<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales\n<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another\n<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be\n<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income\n<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.\n<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in\n<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service\n<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. \"Work only\n<br>5 hours a week,\" would become \"College Students, work only\n<br>5 hours a week.\"&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload\n<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website\n<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).\n<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted\n<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the \"College Students\" page\n<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The \"Senior Citizens\" page could be\n<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.\n<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally\n<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product\n<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a\n<br>match made for them.\n<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences\n<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention\n<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One\n<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales\n<br>letters...\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.\n<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting\n<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,\n<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on\n<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook\n<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. \"Let's\n<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK\n<br>HERE to continue.\"\n<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the\n<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate \"a flood\n<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.\"\n<br>If they do not order today, then they will \"feel like a cat\n<br>that let the mouse get away.\"&nbsp; Use words to create a picture\n<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what\n<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is \"faster\n<br>than a speeding bullet.\"&nbsp; \"More powerful than a locomotive.\"\n<br>\"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.\" See how\n<br>word pictures stick in our minds?\n<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell\n<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only\n<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one\n<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and\n<br>services as back-end products.\n<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are\n<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the\n<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the\n<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must\n<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is\n<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.\n<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the\n<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of \"You won't find\n<br>this anywhere else.\"\n<p>17) Be believable. \"Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!\"\n<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or\n<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that\n<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.\n<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be\n<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will\n<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you\n<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available\n<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they\n<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.\n<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.\n<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but\n<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of \"over 100 tips for losing\n<br>weight\" use \"124 tips for losing weight.\" By generalizing\n<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's\n<br>mind.&nbsp; \"What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?\"\n<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to\n<br>think, \"This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what\n<br>I can expect.\"&nbsp; \"Platitudes and generalities roll off the\n<br>human understanding like water from a duck,\" wrote Claude\n<br>Hopkins in his classic book \"Scientific Advertising.\" \"They\n<br>leave no impression whatsoever.\"\n<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would\n<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of\n<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before\n<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.\n<br>Ask yourself, \"Why wouldn't I buy this?\"&nbsp; Then, address that\n<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the\n<br>reader from making the purchase.\n<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual\n<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about\n<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire\n<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and\n<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the\n<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; \"If these people have\n<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I\n<br>probably will too.\"&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials\n<br>from respected, well known \"authorities\" within your target\n<br>field.\n<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.\n<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your\n<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-\n<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings\n<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next\n<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on\n<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are\n<br>that important.\n<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; \"Wouldn't you like to\n<br>make $1,000,000 a year?\" \"Doesn't that sound great?\" \"Would\n<br>you like to be as successful as I am?\"&nbsp; Avoid any question\n<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them\n<br>feel like they are inferior.\n<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.\n<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a\n<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try\n<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free\n<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to\n<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up\n<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.\n<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having\n<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.\n<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful\n<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they\n<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.\n<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things\n<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters\n<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product\n<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were\n<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial\n<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table\n<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality\n<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages\n<br>the credibility of your main offer.\n<p>25) Use connective phrases like \"But wait, there's more\"\n<br>and \"But that's not all.\"&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead\n<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly\n<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or\n<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE\n<br>value and benefits to the reader.\n<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,\n<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.\n<br>\"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the\n<br>bonuses.\"&nbsp; \"Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,\n<br>I've got to hurry.\"&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will\n<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,\n<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will\n<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines\n<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.\n<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the\n<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell\n<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,\n<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.\n<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.\n<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How\n<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be\n<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can\n<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you\n<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a\n<br>system in place.&nbsp; \"Operators are standing by.\"&nbsp; Their order\n<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.\n<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last\n<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a \"no questions asked\" 30 day\n<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most\n<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give\n<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the\n<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make\n<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your\n<br>product or service RISK-FREE.\n<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people\n<br>just need to read those words, \"Act Now!\"&nbsp; \"Order today!\"\n<br>\"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.\"&nbsp; You've got them\n<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them\n<br>to \"Act Fast!\"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial\n<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right\n<br>way?\n<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the\n<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT\n<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the\n<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the\n<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A\n<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they\n<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed\n<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use\n<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.\n<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe\n<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use\n<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer\n<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would\n<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.\n<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see\n<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you\n<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be\n<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>Copyright 2000 Jimmy D.

Because we require an initial fee to get\nstarted, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.\nThis fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time\nit takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about\nworking with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-\nMailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their\ntestimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue\nour success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials\nreceived from Home-Mailers:\n  \n  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity\n  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along\n  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is\n  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes\n  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us\n  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!\n     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL\n  \n  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble\n  making ends meet at my present employment. But\n  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was\n  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the\n  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well\n  deserved vacation.\n     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA\n  \nWhy do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more\nexpensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square\nfoot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +\ntaxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,\nmultiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants\nand more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!\nYour role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an\nemployee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer\nmedical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many\nother aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business\nexpenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of\npersonal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can \nbe done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you\nreceive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a\nsteady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior\nexperience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who\nwant to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher \nexpenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn \nmoney doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help \npeople cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers\nProgram has been perfected so that it has become one of the most \nsuccessful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the\nworld with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take\npart in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require \nthat you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on\nwhatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop\nwhenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any\ndoor to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your\nown home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave\nyour present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family \nto join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!\n  \n  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION\n  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.\n  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working\n  with you, together in the future.\n  \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  <B>\n</B>\n</FONT></HTML>",

What you do to \n <BR>become successful in the online world is not a \"secret\", \n <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, \n <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the \n <BR>Net or off.\n <BR>\n <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, \n <BR>consultation, or simply asking, \"What's your secret?\", \n <BR>I have to blush & say ...\n <BR>\n <BR>Persistence and personality.\n <BR>\n <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little \n <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the \n <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over \n <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  \n <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.\n <BR>\n <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. \n <BR>It's not years of digging to find the \"secrets\" to internet riches.\n <BR>\n <BR>One thing that \"gets to me\" so often in my work as an \n <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success \n <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to \n <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands \n <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's \n <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims \n <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many \n <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in \n <BR>their online venture, that \"success\" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.\n <BR>\n <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!\n <BR>\n <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau \n <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking \n<BR>the Bank. Get it!! \n <BR><a href=\"http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb\">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . \n <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks \n <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your \n <BR>online venture a success. \n <BR>\n <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of \n <BR>\"self marketing\" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's \n <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't \n <BR>agree with him more.\n <BR>\n <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to \n <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your \n <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' \n <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! \n <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.\n <BR>\n <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have \n <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path \n <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is \n <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there \n <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!\n <BR>\n <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between \n <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. \n <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick \n <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous \n <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, \n <BR>which is the only \"real\" place it ever was anyhow!\n <BR>\n <BR>Yes, \"persistence and personality\" inherently includes \n <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other \n <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate \n <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  \n <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!\n <BR>\n <BR>That may be the most incredible \"secret\" we ever \n <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall \n <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.\n <BR>\n <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!\n <BR>\n <BR>------------------------------------------------------\n <BR>Bryan is a \"veteran\"  Internet  Consultant, Author, \n <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.

What you do to \n <BR>become successful in the online world is not a \"secret\", \n <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, \n <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the \n <BR>Net or off.\n <BR>\n <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, \n <BR>consultation, or simply asking, \"What's your secret?\", \n <BR>I have to blush & say ...\n <BR>\n <BR>Persistence and personality.\n <BR>\n <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little \n <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the \n <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over \n <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  \n <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.\n <BR>\n <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. \n <BR>It's not years of digging to find the \"secrets\" to internet riches.\n <BR>\n <BR>One thing that \"gets to me\" so often in my work as an \n <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success \n <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to \n <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands \n <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's \n <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims \n <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many \n <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in \n <BR>their online venture, that \"success\" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.\n <BR>\n <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!\n <BR>\n <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau \n <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking \n<BR>the Bank. Get it!! \n <BR><a href=\"http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb\">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . \n <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks \n <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your \n <BR>online venture a success. \n <BR>\n <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of \n <BR>\"self marketing\" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's \n <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't \n <BR>agree with him more.\n <BR>\n <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to \n <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your \n <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' \n <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! \n <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.\n <BR>\n <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have \n <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path \n <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is \n <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there \n <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!\n <BR>\n <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between \n <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. \n <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick \n <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous \n <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, \n <BR>which is the only \"real\" place it ever was anyhow!\n <BR>\n <BR>Yes, \"persistence and personality\" inherently includes \n <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other \n <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate \n <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  \n <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!\n <BR>\n <BR>That may be the most incredible \"secret\" we ever \n <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall \n <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.\n <BR>\n <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!\n <BR>\n <BR>------------------------------------------------------\n <BR>Bryan is a \"veteran\"  Internet  Consultant, Author, \n <BR>Internet Success Strategist & Marketer.

This is often because webmasters do not have the\nability or time to design and create unique websites. These\nfive points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design\nfor your website.\n\n1. Navigation System\n\nDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first\nthings to consider when designing your website. Visitors\nusually look for a way to get to the information they want\nbefore reading anything else. I would suggest putting your\nnavigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase \n(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list \nof categories on the left, and information about the network \non the top bar.\n\nIt is not recommended that you place your navigation at the\nbottom of the page because:\n\n- People see the top of the page first\n- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets\n   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.\n\n2. Color Scheme\n\nWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For\nexample, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some\ncolors that are often used are white on black or black on\nwhite.\n\nA wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer\n(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron\nEpstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in\nchoosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles \n(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),\nor Download.com (http://www.download.com) for \"color schemer.\"\n\n3. Content Window\n\nThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here\nis easy to read and understand.\n\nAlso, provide your own original content. People do not want to\nhear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what \nyou want to say! While it might be time consuming to write\nyour own content, it sure is worth it.\n\nTo find content for your website, try searching at\nEzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may\nhave used the articles, but if you become good friends with the\nauthors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be\ncareful though. Do not use too much content from other \nauthors, as mentioned above.\n\n4. Font(s)\n\nSeveral types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is\nfixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.\nFixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)\n\nAnother type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to\nArial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be \nused for long pieces of text.\n\nThe final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,\nor curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times\n(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,\nis often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because\nits rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it\neasier to read.\n\n5. Advertising\n\nAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing \nthat almost every website has. The most common type is what \nis known as \"banner\" advertising. It is called that because it is \nlong and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The \ngeneric kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.\n\nNew sizes however are being used. Take for example the new\nstyle called \"skyscraper\" -- so called for a reason: it looks\nlike a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too\nwide (about 100-125 pixels.)\n\nFinding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners \nused to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.\nNevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle\nof the page, at the bottom, or along the side.\n\n    Conclusion\n\nThese are only five things to consider when designing a\nwebsite. There are many others however. Let me know what \nyou find that helps you create a unique website.

This is often because webmasters do not\n<br>have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.\n<br>These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind\n<br>design for your website.\n<p>1. Navigation System\n<p>Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first\n<br>things to consider when designing your website. Visitors\n<br>usually look for a way to get to the information they want\n<br>before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your\n<br>navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase\n<br>(<a href=\"http://www.webmasterbase.com\">http://www.webmasterbase.com</a>)\nfor example. There is a list\n<br>of categories on the left, and information about the network\n<br>on the top bar.\n<p>It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the\n<br>bottom of the page because:\n<p>- People see the top of the page first\n<br>- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the\nvisitor.\n<p>2. Color Scheme\n<p>When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.\n<br>For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.\n<br>Some colors that are often used are white on black or black\n<br>on white.\n<p>A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color\n<br>Schemer (<a href=\"http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/\">http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/</a>),\n<br>created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that\n<br>can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on\n<br>FreewareFiles (<a href=\"http://www.freewarefiles.com\">http://www.freewarefiles.com</a>),\nTucows\n<br>(<a href=\"http://www.tucows.com\">http://www.tucows.com</a>), or Download.com\n<br>(<a href=\"http://www.download.com\">http://www.download.com</a>) for\n\"color schemer.\"\n<p>3. Content Window\n<p>This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text\n<br>here is easy to read and understand.\n<p>Also, provide your own original content. People do not want\n<br>to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear\n<br>what <i>you</i> want to say! While it might be time consuming to\n<br>write your own content, it sure is worth it.\n<p>To find content for your website, try searching at\n<br>EzineArticles (<a href=\"http://www.ezinearticles.com\">http://www.ezinearticles.com</a>).\nOther people\n<br>may have used the articles, but if you become good friends\n<br>with the authors, they may send you new content as they\n<br>write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content\n<br>from other authors, as mentioned above.\n<p>4. Font(s)\n<p>Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is\n<br>fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.\n<br>Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)\n<p>Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to\n<br>Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can\n<br>be used for long pieces of text.\n<p>The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,\n<br>or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times\n<br>(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,\n<br>is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because\n<br>its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making\n<br>it easier to read.\n<p>5. Advertising\n<p>Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing\n<br>that almost every website has. The most common type is\n<br>what is known as \"banner\" advertising. It is called that\n<br>because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long\n<br>you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.\n<p>New sizes however are being used. Take for example the\n<br>new style called \"skyscraper\" -- so called for a reason: it\n<br>looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not\n<br>too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)\n<p>Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners\n<br>used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the\n<br>page.&nbsp; Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in\n<br>the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.\n<p>Conclusion\n<p>These are only five things to consider when designing a\n<br>website. There are many others however. Let me know\n<br>what you find that helps you create a unique website.

My \n>defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan \n>disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be. \n\nDear Nicety,\n\nAs regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking \nup your computer I'm afraid your \"SOL\" as finding a true solution.  \nThere are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts \nresulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many \nprograms don't release memory when you exit.  When working \nin Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a \nregular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened \nand closed several different applications.\n\nBack in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,\nwrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating\nsystem vs Windows NT.  You can read it at \nhttp://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is \neven truer today.  Every current \"worm\" you are hearing about \non the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. \n\n So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change \nthe OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of \nweeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running \nI can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. \nI have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and \nthe price is right -- free.\n\nJim Shofstall\nwebmaster@wonderpaint.com\nhttp://www.wonderpaint.com\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n\n>>>>>> WEBSITE SHOWCASES <<<<<<\n\nExamine carefully - those with email addresses included WILL\ntrade links with you, you are encouraged to contact them.

They are both very attractive and well \npresented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been \na little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, \npreparing me for the site that it links to, and having a \nrelationship to it.\n\nWhat I did feel most, was that I was expecting something \nrelated to the url  \"prosperouswomen\" to come up, as this \n\"word\" was what caught my attention and caused me to \nclick in the first place.\n\nI feel the book page should be a tool for the \"PW\" page and \nnot a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the \nbook site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.\n(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)\n\nWith these:\n\nFind out how you can receive the free book.\nEmail us at directions4U@aol.com        \nand\nFor this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing \nwrite to us at directions4U@aol.com\n\nI would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than \ncopy and paste.\n\nVery nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. \n(and I have ordered the book!)\n~~~~\n\nI waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  \nCould not determine if this was related to volume of graphics \nor where we were headed.\n~~~~\n\nVery clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.\n\nDon't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish \nbetween the links and that which is not.\n\nI finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also \nlinked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that \nlink more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.\n\nIf you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a \nrequest message to an aol email address you would get more \nrequests, and also might be able to automate this process.\n~~~~\n\nI loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.\nIt also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  \nIf only other sites we so simplistic!\n~~~~\n\nWith the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact \non Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences \nin the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box \nwith \"Life Changeing Insight\" needs the 'e' taken out of \n'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended \nto go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 \nyear old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of \nusing the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where \nor how or by whom it was discovered.\n\nThe message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that \nwould make the site more effective (on getting people to request \nthe book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in \nwhat format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to \norder instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form \nfor this just about anywhere.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n______________________________________________________\nmoderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nposting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\n______________________________________________________\n\nSend posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\nPlease send suggestions and comments to:\n   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\n\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new\nand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nSee below for unsubscribe instructions.\n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n\n----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.6vihnja6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com",

By getting clear \non and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be \nmoving toward and experiencing your highest and best.\n\n\n1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for\nwhich I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will\nhave even more to appreciate.\n\n2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize \nhow my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. \nEXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly \nimagine.\n\n3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.\n\n4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and \ndrink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more \ncalories. Eat only small amounts at one time.\n\n5. Read something educational, inspirational or\nentertaining--preferably all three.\n\n6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the\nSuper-conscious.\n\n7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.\n\n8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of \nmy book, then write in my journal.\n\n9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, \nmagnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.\n\n10. Finish something.

I hear about so many \npeople being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, \nI can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address \nand about 90% of the time I can get the number.  \n\nWe are so worried about putting our credit card number on\nthe net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and \nthey take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do \nwho knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person \ntell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy \nof her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that \nperson (me) would have her account info and could write \na check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send \nit to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her \nto tell me what the difference was between the original check \nand a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never \nheard back from her.  \n\nThe bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is \navailable in many places.  Have a good day.\n--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nYes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, \nwe can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most \nimportantly, never give any personal information at a site \nthat is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar \nor a Veri secure sign or others. \n\nAlso, never leave your information stored at a site. I put \nin my credit information in each time instead of having \nan account in standing, a little more time but less risks \ninvolved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet \nmall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is \ndeleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web \nto be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!\n--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com \n~~~~~~~~~\n\nYes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that \nmy ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner \nwas in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  \nMy Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address \nwent unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; \nand, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com \naddress to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building \nup 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place \non 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I \nlost a minimum of $50,000.  \n \nI have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first \ntime I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often \nenough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet \ntheft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals \nand should spend years behind bars.\n \nCustomers are well protected from credit card theft; \nhowever, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by \npurchase order and certified or registered company checks.\n--  Peter S.    http://www.GSSGeomatics.com\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n               JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED!\nAnd the July 'One-Question Survey' WINNER is...\n\n           John Stitzel   -   oldstitz@yahoo.com\n\n                   Congratulations John!\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new and old \naddress to mailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \nSee the link (below) for our Subscription Center to unsubscribe \nor edit your interests. \n\nPlease send suggestions and comments to: \nmailto:Editor@AEOpublishing.com \nI invite you to send your real successes and showcase \nyour strategies and techniques, or yes, even your total bombs, \n\"Working Together We Can All Prosper.\" \nmailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \n\nFor information on how to sponsor Your Membership \nCommunity & Commentary visit: http://bannersgomlm.com/ezine \n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing.com \n------------------------------------------------\nweb: http://www.AEOpublishing.com\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.8lhtdma6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com\n--1465727098.996838841831.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n<HTML>\n<!-- \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOW\n\nThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by email\nclients that can properly display it.

I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,\n<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most\n<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site\n<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar\n<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.\n<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put\n<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having\n<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks\n<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet\n<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is\n<br>deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web\n<br>to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!\n<br>--&nbsp; Catherine F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com\">http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com</a>\n<br>~~~~~~~~~\n<p>Yes.

(Issue #439)\n>\n>My computer freezes when I use AOL and sometimes when\n>I'm just using the basic functions of Windows 98. My\n>defragmentor  keeps starting over and over and my scan\n>disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.\n\nHello Nicety,\n\nI  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,  \nwhen he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:\n\n<snip>\n One major problem is that many programs don't release memory \nwhen you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the \napproach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, \n</snip>\n\nI believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much \nnegates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer \nfor reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's \nfavourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I \nhave to make it do anything useful. \n\nIf you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE \ndownload called FreeMem which you can get here;\nhttp://www.meikel.com\n\nThis utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you \nalso get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. \nThis may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be \nrunning at peak performance all the time and much easier than \nconstant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these \nlittle third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to \nsearch for.\n\nHTH.

It's very flashy and maybe\njust a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around\nyour site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone\nthree pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to\nmake your front page navigation a little less confusing?\n\nThe \"next page\" tab is right next to one that says \"bookmark\nthis page\" - no information until you mouseover the tab to\ntell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed\nwith glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not\nenough information on your openning page.\n~~~~\n\nI also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL\nending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.\n1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the\nanimation and red text on the yellow background, missing\nthe first sentence. Remove the animation and add more\ndetails to this important introduction. Instead of using the\n'click here' button, just have a text link following directly\nafter the introduction.\n2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,\nand all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on\nwhat is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text\non the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially\nwhen it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the\nimportant links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.\n3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but\nyou don't need the top menu bar when using the framed\nmenu and the pages are all untitled.\n\nI hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you\nwant the best site you can have and I think these changes\nwill make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the\nsite you have the information organized and complete. I\neven wanted to come and stay!\n~~~~\n\nThe animations make this site look amateurish from the\nbeginning.  The flashing \"Bookmark This Site\" makes me\nwant to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans\nMS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve\nthis site.\n~~~~\n\nI was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the\nfirst screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between\nthem. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know\nwhere to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should\nhave been up by the text and that is where I should go.\n\nOn the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,\nthe 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One\nsuggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have\nthe menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of\nthe page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.\n\nThe font style and bright colors made the site look casual and\nlaid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.\nBesides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but\nif I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten\nthat far.\n~~~~\n\nThis site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read\nand navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.\nSome pages had too many animated images for my own taste,\nbut the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold\nof PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that\nform a background for some images.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n______________________________________________________\nmoderator: Amy Mossel:  Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nposting:  MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\n______________________________________________________\n\nSend posts and questions (or your answers) to:\n   mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.com\nPlease send suggestions and comments to:\n   mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\n\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new\nand old address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.com\nSee below for unsubscribe instructions.\n\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing\n\n----- End of Your Membership Exchange\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\n\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.jbozuta6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\n\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\n\nPowered by \nConstant Contact(R)\nwww.constantcontact.com",

Did I or Natasha Fedorova write \nyou before to your other address? Anyway, now I am here instead of \nher too.\n\nSo, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nI have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see, \npossibly you will find it interesting.\n\nPeople are seeking to cut costs with this economy slow-down, right?\n\nThe thing is that I could get you in touch with developers from\nRussia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for\nconsiderably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or \npay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all\nprogramming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content\nwriting, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may\naccept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and\ndevote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.\nAlternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more\nfeatures to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from\n$12, and an average of $18 an hour.\n\nI have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html\n\nAs for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their\nspecialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.\nSo, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet \ndeadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant \nis online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also \ntheir company has local consultants in many states throughout the \nUSA, in Europe and Australia.\n\nSo, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?\n\nThank you very much,\nOksana Svetlova.\noksana@antee.com\n\nPS.

But first permit me to say that I\ndo not know you; you are receiving this mail via blind\ncarbon copy of email addresses which I obtained from a\nsimple internet search. You are therefore NOT obliged\nto reply. However, if you do, and the conditions are\nright, you will be amply compensated. It is also\npertinent to add that I am using an assumed name, and\nfree web based email addresses for my personal\nprotection .\n \nIn order to give you a background of this \"business\ntransaction\", please check the website  \n\nhttp://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC\n\nBefore proceeding further, please permit me to give\nyou more background on the Abacha family \"MILLIONS\" as\nit is now known; please check the following websites\n \nhttp://www.oneworld.org/ips2/aug98/17_29_059.html\n\nhttp://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=974\n\nI have taken some pains to give you readings on the\nAbacha Family fortunes; They are of  course a matter\nof public record, and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES INDEED THAT\nGENERAL SANI ABACHA TRANSFERRED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nOUT OF NIGERIA ! However, it is conceivable and even\nlogical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN\n\"DISCOVERED\" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN\nSYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT\nOF NIGERIA. AND THIS IS A FACT!\n\nThe truth of the matter is that much more of the\nAbacha fortunes are still hidden , their location a\nclosely guarded secret; Her Excellency, Hajia\nAbacha,widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, ex-head of\nState of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998\nand her immediate family are under house arrest in\nNigeria. It is therefore my job to search out a\nreliable person, a complete stranger to help\ntransfer/secure a negotiated amount from the still\nhidden millions of Dollars.  The right person must\npass a background check in order to avoid my being\nbetrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.\nIt is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name\nfor the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid\nleakages. Though I am using the internet which is\nlargely unsafe, as soon as I get a \"reliable\"\ncandidate, I will introduce security measures for\nevery body's protection. For the moment I am simply a\n\"Contact Person\" for the REAL Abacha family.\n\nIn sum, the person I am looking for is an individual\nor corporate body that is able to provide one or more\nBank Accounts into which arrangements will be made to\ntransfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every\nweek; The routine, periodic transfers in small\ninstalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in\nthe wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and\nproperly legal, and with all proper bank\ndocumentation. The right person may need to establish \nfresh/new RECEIVING BANK accounts free from legal or\nfinancial encumbrances. Persons with bad credit rating\n, undischarged bankrupts, companies in receivership\nand minors need not reply; Because of the stature and\nconfidentiality of this proposed transaction, a\nsuccessful candidate will receive 25% of all\ntransfers.

The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.\"\n\nMore than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Faades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc. \nScience Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.\n\nBecause of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)\n\nFor more information: <A HREF=\"mailto:reports@the-financial-news.com\">Mini-plants in mobile containers</A>\n\nBy Steven P.

Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim. To this effect,I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every documentto be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines,\nSo you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money\nwill be for you, 10%for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be\ndonated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues\nand I.

This is by virtue of its nature\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. \nThough I know that a transaction of this magnitude\nwill make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am\nassuring you that all will be well at the end of the\nday. \n\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\ndecided it is best using the email. \n\nLet me start by first introducing myself properly to\nyou. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the\nMinistry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man\ntender board appointed by the Government of the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to\nindividuals and companies and to approve such contract\npayments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The\nduties of the committee also include evaluation,\nvetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign\nand local contractors in the ministry.\n\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \n\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\nrural electrification projects. \n\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\nintention that the committee will share the excess\nwhen the payments are approved. \n\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\nand contractors concerned which executed the\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\nourselves.\n\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\nhandicapped in this circumstances as the civil service\ncode of conduct, does not allow us to operate\noff-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole\ntransaction is highly needed . \n\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \n\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not\nwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.\n\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\ncases of business associates running away with funds\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\nbe based completely on the following: \n\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\ndiligence. \n\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \n\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \n\n(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough\ninformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. \n\nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\nrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten\nBank working days from the date of receipt of the\nnecessary information and requirement from you. \n\nEndeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter\nusing my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email\naddress and I will bring you into the complete picture\nof this transaction when I have heard from you. \n\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated as we\nare already behind schedule for this financial\nquarter. \n\nThank you and God bless. \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nDr. Osaro Ame \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!\nse!\n, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?\n\nSincerely,\n\nRJ\n\nLocation: Midwest, U.S.A.\n\nThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.\n\n-- Frankie R.\n\nLocation: West Coast, USA\n\nIm a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!  \n\n-- A.J.\n\nLocation: United Kingdom\n========================================================\nFinally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive.

In addition,\n\n       \"E-mail is without question the most powerful\n        method of distributing information on earth\"\n\nWell, I think you get the picture.

YOU GET DETAILED, EASY TO FOLLOW STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS\n********************************************************\n  \nAND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG ...\nAs you read on you'll discover how a 'Seen on National TV'\nprogram is paying out excellent returns, every 4 to 5 months\nfrom your home, for a minimal initial startup investment of\nonly $25 US Dollars. ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE\nAND THE INTERNET!\n\nThis is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.\nDue to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the\ninvestigation of this program described below, to see if it really\ncan make people money.\n\nThis is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable \nopportunity. I was approached many times before but each time \nI passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what \none could expect in return for the minimal effort and money \nrequired.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income \nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n=====================================================================\nHere is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for \na long time but I never believed in it.  But one day when I received \nthis again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed \nthe simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money \nstarted to come in.  First month I only made a small amount of money,  \nbut the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  \nSo far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made \na lot more and I am playing it again.  The key to success in this \nprogram is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  \n\n=====================================================================\nMore testimonials later but first:\n\n*****PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE & FOLLOW THESE\nSIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS TRUE! *****\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n============\n**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.\n\n**** For each report, send $5 U.S. CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER\nOF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to\nthe person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\n\n  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE\n  TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\n\n  **** When you place your order, make sure\n       you order each of the 5 reports ****\n\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your\ncomputer and resell them.\n\nYOUR UP-FRONT COST is ONLY $5 X 5 = $25.00.\n\n*********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save\nthem on your computer so they will be accessible for you to\nsend to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.\nAlso make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk\nin case something happens to your computer.\n\n**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people\nwho are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the\nlist, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps\n1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.\nOnce you understand the way this works, you will also see how\nit does not work if you change it.\n\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,\nit will NOT work! People have tried to put their friends/relatives\nnames on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it\ndoes not work this way.

Remember,\nhonesty reaps the reward!!!\n\n1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in\nREPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is\nno doubt counting their money.\n\n2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.\n3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.\n4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.\n5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.\n6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!\n=========================================================\n\nTake this entire letter, with the modified list of names,\nand save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any\ndata.\n\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,\nthe 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable\nmarketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails\nlegally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and\nmuch, much more.\n\nThere are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\n\n  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n  =======================================\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how\nit goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out\nonly 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing\nreceive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much\nbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people\nmay send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each).\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each\nfor a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and\nordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\neach for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is\n10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out\n5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)\nEmails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half\nmillion).\n\n  Your total income in this example is:\n  1..... $50 +\n  2..... $500 +\n  3..... $5,000 +\n  4..... $50,000 +\n  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00\n\n  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\n  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\n  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\n  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.\n\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,\nor 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\neach or more?  There are over 500 million people on the\nInternet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people\nmay do just that, and more!\n\n  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n  ===================================================\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there\nare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of\nfree ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD\n# 2 as you go along.\n\nFor every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\nReport they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day\nservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails\nthey send out, with your name and address on it, will be\nprompt because they can not advertise until they receive the\nreport.\n\n  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\n\nNote:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.\nChecks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash\nis wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in\nthe envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER\nand the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,\nyour NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper\n'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your\ncountry.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n=============================================================\n\n\nReport 1: The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On \nThe Net ...

If you\ndid not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\n\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU\nCAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you!\n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved\ndown on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report\npeople are ordering from you.\n\n  IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF\nE-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN!!!\n  ____________________________________________________\n\n  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\n\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it\nin any way.  It works exceedingly well as it is now.\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you\nhave put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others\nto #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the people\nyou send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\nname will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more\nyou send out the more potential customers you will reach.\n\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,\nmaterials and opportunity .... IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!\n\n==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS======================\n\n'' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  \nI am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make \npretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled \nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the \nwhole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \npercentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody \ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later \nshe jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, \nand was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when \nthe thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within \n3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days \nshe had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I\nhave joined Jody in her ''hobby''. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n===============================================================\n\n'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make \nup my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that \nI am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \nleast get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my \nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large \n6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this \ndeal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply \nisn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.\nDan\nSondstrom, Alberta,\nCanada\n================================================================\n\n'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later \nI wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no \nidea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until \nI was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed \nthen it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I \nmade a six figure income on my first try and all the money came\nwithin 22 weeks''. \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n================================================================\n\n'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money \nwith little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions \ncarefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My \nfirst month I made a substantial income and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.\nLife is beautiful, Thanks to internet''. \nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n\n================================================================\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON\nYOUR ROAD TO GENERATING EXTRA INCOME! \n================================================================\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe sender or participants of this marketing program cannot\nverify any monetary claims made in this document, nor do they\nassume responsibility for same.

Leibacher, The Financial News, Editor\n\n\nMini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles. Programa de Co-inversion\n\n\"...Science Network suministrara a paises y regiones en vias de desarrollo la tecnologia y el apoyo necesario para la fabricacion en serie de Mini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles (40-foot). El sistema de mini-plantas esta diseado de forma que todas las maquinas de produccion van instaladas fijas sobre la propia plataforma del contenedor, con el cableado, tuberias e instalaciones; es decir, completamente equipadas... y a partir de ese momento estn listas para producir.\" \nMas de 700 sistemas de produccion portatil: Panaderias, Produccin de clavos de acero, Electrodos para soldadura, Recauchutado de neumaticos, Curvado de hierro para armaduras de construccion, Lamina perfilada para cubiertas, techos y cerramientos de fachada, Bidones de chapa, Cubos de aluminio, Menaje de polipropileno inyectado, Piezas de melamina prensada (vasos, platos, tazas, cafeteras, etc.) Silenciadores para vehiculos, Malla electrosoldada para la construccion, Bolsas y envases de plastico, Unidades moviles de asistencia medica, Material sanitario (jeringas hipodermicas, Pinzas hemostaticas, etc.)\n\nScience Network ha puesto en marcha un proceso de Co-inversion para la instalacion de pequeas Plantas ensambladoras para fabricar en serie las Mini-plantas de produccion portatil, en el lugar, region o pais que lo necesite. Una de las caractersticas relevantes es el hecho de que dichas plantas quedaran conectadas al Sistema del Comercio Mundial (WTS) con acceso a mas de 50 millones de mercancias, materia primas, productos, servicios y las operaciones automaticas de comercio internacional. \nResulta obvio que por razones economicas, de costes y de impacto social, lo apropiado es instalar plantas ensambladoras en los mismos paises y regiones asi como utilizar los recursos locales (mano de obra, ciertos equipamientos, etc.)\n\nPara recibir mas infromacion: <A HREF=\"mailto:reports@the-financial-news.com\">Mini-plantas de produccion en contenedores moviles</A>\n\nSteven P.

        "content": "Date:May 16,2002. \nEmail:edum@hkem.com. \n\nDear Sir, \n\nI am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal \nCommanders of the Union for the Total Independence of \nAngola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story \nhere for our story is indeed interwoven with the \nhistory of the world and the liberation struggle in \nthe Southern African region of the African continent. \nThe bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme \ncommander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an \nencounter with the government forces of the MPLA \ngovernment of my country.The rest is now history but \nsuffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate \nrole of waging a war against my fatherland.I have \ntherefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush \neven if the other field commanders decide otherwise am \ntherefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life \nand I have decided to make South Africa my new home at \nleast for the interim period until I am sufficiently \nsure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by \nthe MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. \nNeedles to say I was the single most important \ncommander who was very close to the late supreme \ncommander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a \nbrother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great \ndeal.The result of such trust is my reason for \ncontacting you I was the commander whom he sent to \ndeposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) \nwith a security/finance company in South Africa.This \nwas immediately after the events of September 11,2001 \nin the United States of America.Indeed it had become \nincreasingly difficult to move large volumes of money \naround the world particularly for a liberation \nmovement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the \nmoney with the security company in South Africa. I \nhave decided to inherit this money which was taken out \nand deposited with the said security/finance company \nas cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is \nkept in my signature and would have been used in the \npurchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of \ncontinuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme \ncommander is dead and as already stated I have decided \nto quite the whole thing and this is without regard to \nthe fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! \nI want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit \nthe $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have \nbeen able to establish contact with the company in \nSouth Africa to the effect that I would soon come to \ntake possession of the money that I kept with them. \nNote also that I deposited the money as a foreign \nnational who is the head of a Mining company in Angola \n(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to \ncooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% \nof the $32million.Please come back to me through \nemail: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance \ncompany is standing by to receive my instructions on \nthis and I will link you up with them as soon as you \nare ready to take possession of the $32million. \nFinally you are to note that in you reply, you are to \nstate your residential or company address and if \npossible send a copy of your international passport so \nas to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. \nYours truly, \nEduado de Mello \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\ndcms-dev mailing list\ndcms-dev@eros.cs.jhu.edu\nhttp://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/dcms-dev",

        "content": "FROM:MR JOE MARK\nEMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791\nEMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com\n\nDEAR SIR\n \nREQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  STRICTLY\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n \nFirstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality\nin this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature\nas being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though\nI know that a transaction of this magnitude will make\nanyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you\nthat all will be well at the end of the day. \n\nWe have decided to contact you first by your email due\nto the urgency of this transaction, as we have been\nreliably informed that it will take at least two to\nthree weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we\ndecided it is best using the email. Let me start by\nfirst introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.\nKaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry \nof Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board\nappointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of\nNigeria to award contracts to individuals and\ncompanies and to approve such contract payments in the\nMinistry of Mines and Power. The duties of the\ncommittee also include evaluation, vetting and\nmonitoring of work done by foreign and local\ncontractors in the ministry.\n\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\nbusiness transaction which involves the transfer of a\nhuge sum of money to a foreign account requiring\nmaximum confidence. In order to commence this\nbusiness, we solicit for your assistance to enable us\ntransfer into your account the said funds. \n\nThe source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996\nand 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various\ncontractors for engineering, procurement, supply of\nelectrical equipments such as Transformers, and some\nrural electrification projects. \n\nHowever, these contracts were over-invoiced by the\ncommittee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million\ndollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United\nStates Dollars) in excess. This was done with the\nintention that the committee will share the excess\nwhen the payments are approved. \n\nThe Federal Government have since approved the total\ncontract sum which has been paid out to the companies\nand contractors concerned which executed the\ncontracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,\nwhich we need your assistance to transfer into a safe\noff-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst\nourselves.\n\nWe need your assistance as the funds are presently\nsecured in an escrow account of the Federal Government\nspecifically set aside for the settlement of\noutstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are\nhandicapped \nin the circumstances as the civil service code of\nconduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore\naccounts, hence your importance in the whole\ntransaction. \n\nMy colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your\ncompany can act as the beneficiary of this funds on\nour behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the\ntotal amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\nremaining 10% will be used in offsetting all\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\nthe cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. \n\nIt does not matter whether or not your company does\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\ncontracts. We are civil servants and we will not want\nto miss this once in a life time opportunity.\n\nYou must however, NOTE that this transaction will be\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\ncases of business associates running away with funds\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\naccounts. We have decided that this transaction will\nbe based completely on the following: \n\n(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and\ndiligence. \n\n(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost\nsecrecy and confidentiality. \n\n(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly\nrelease our share (70%) on demand after you have\nremoved your 20% and all expenses have been settled. \n\n(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough\ninformation about yourself to put our minds at rest. \n\nPlease, note that this transaction is 100% legal and\nrisk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten\nBank working days from the date of  receipt of the\nnecessary information and requirement from you. \n\nEndeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter\nusing my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email\naddress mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into\nthe\ncomplete picture of the transaction when I have heard\nfrom you. \n\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated as we\nare already behind schedule for this financial\nquarter. \n\nThank you and God bless. \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nMr Joe Mark\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nLAUNCH - Your Yahoo!

For every Judgment that is paid, 5more<BR>\nJudgments take its place.<BR>\n<BR>\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>\ntechniques necessary to succeed.<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>\nprocessing of Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession.</FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"><B>We<BR>\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>\nand $100,000.00 per year</FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\">.</B> Some choose to operateout of<BR>\ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>\nare women and 36% are part time .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court.

Read this email to the end, follow the\ninstructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your\nretirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I\nknow what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these\nbefore either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25\ngoing to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing\nthis same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why\nthat day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close\nto imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.\n\nRead on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.\nNot only are you making money from your own business, you're\nhelping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.\nGive it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get\nAT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.\n\n\nOkay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):\n\n==================================================\n\nDue to the popularity of this particular email business, and the\nbusiness potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program\nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program\nto see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.\n\nTheir findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting\nthe participation in the program, and if people can follow a few\nsimple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only\n$25 in startup costs.\"\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE\nWHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU\nWILL MAKE.\n\nThis is what one had to say:\n\n\"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but\neach time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out\nthat night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in\nthis business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.\nTwo weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars\nrolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.\nThen it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find\n$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I\njust bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so\nsmall, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.\nGive it a shot - what do you have to lose?\"\n\nPam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n==================================================\n\nAnother said:\n\n\"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never\nbelieved in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to\nwin the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I\nfelt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other\n$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions\nmeticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.\nAs soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled\nmy $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and\nthat's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already\nup $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.\nOn an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always\nsay that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant\nto be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it\nsays - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.\"\n\nGreg Moran, Boston, MA.\n\nFor more success stories and photos, go to http://www.cashbynet.net\n\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME\nTRUE, GUARANTEED.\n\nBE SURE TO SAVE A COPY OF THIS EMAIL AS A TEXT DOCUMENT FOR REFERENCE!!!!\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n=====Order all 5 reports from your personal CBN money list below =====\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.

Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable\nin a short period of time, and have something many people can't - a\nprofitable business enterprise (and more money to do WHATEVER YOU COULD\nPOSSIBLY WANT).\n\nFor more information go to http://www.cashbynet.net\n\n==================================================\nHERE IS YOUR PERSONAL CBN MONEY LIST :\n==================================================\n\nREPORT# 1: 'The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net\n\nOrder Report #1 from:\n\nChris King\n905 HWY 321 NW PMB 131\nHickory, NC 28601\n_______________________________________________________\n\nREPORT # 2: The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net\n\nOrder Report # 2 from:\n\nGreg Ferris\n264 S.

Notes: Always send $5 USD\ncash for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is\nconcealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those\nsheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are\nordering,\nYOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, your name AND postal address.\n_______________________________________________________\n\nPLEASE READ ON . . .\n\n=======================\nIMPORTANT!! STEPS 1-6\n=======================\n\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports from your CBN money list, take\nthis original saved email and REMOVE the name & address of the person in\nREPORT # 5.  This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt\ncounting their fortune.\n\n2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.\n\n3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.\n\n4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.\n\n5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2\n\n6.. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!\nThis is critical to YOUR success.\n\n==================================================\n**** SAVE THE NEW MODIFIED EMAIL, AS THIS WILL BE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT\nWHICH YOU WILL SEND TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS. BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME\nIN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS\nDOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND\nSUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****\n\nAs soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!\nThese are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do\nthese reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,\nyou will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5\nreports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to\nsend bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified\nads and much more.\n\nThere are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:\n\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,\nand we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails\neach. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%\n(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just\nsay it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of\nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this\nexample, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\n\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100\npeople responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail\nsent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000\n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million\ndollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....\n$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nREMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\neach or more?\n\nTHE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT\nhttp://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to\nplug in your own numbers and see the results.\n\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly\nsuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to\nbecome more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.\nRemember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure\nproper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.\n\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\n\n**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash\nwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a\ndifferent report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER\nBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\n\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:\n\nCash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole\nproprietors.

This is not something \nthat I would normally look at, except that I read an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about \nPayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it \nwould work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had\nalready experienced their efficiency and good standing. \nYou can complete this whole process in one hour and you \nwill never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! \nDid I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the \nInternet-type fast.' Everything is done on the\nInternet by E-mail.\n\nNEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from\nindividuals who decided to invest nothing more than a \nlittle of their time.\n\nTESTIMONIALS FROM:\n\nTony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:\nHey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of\nour frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 \ngrand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run \nthis program again........\n\nMary Gathers, Columbia, SC:\nHey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to\nyou... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said \nand went on vacation. When I got back, my account was \nup to over $12,000! I owe you!\n\nGETTING STARTED.\n\nIf you're not already a user, the very first thing you\nneed to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes \nand PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this \nprogram FREE!\n\nHere's the link:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\nBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO \n$100 \nDOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!\n\nThen...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) \nto the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note\nlike \"Please add me to your mailing list.\" BE PREPARED TO GET\nEXCITED.... YOU \nWON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the \nothers \nto start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No \nprinting, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US \nPostal and \nLottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, \nSection 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal \nRegulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a \nproduct or service must be exchanged for money received). \n\nHere's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this \nTHREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much\nfaster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY \nHIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see \nresults in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT \nMONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 \nor more as in other programs). Ideally, you should\nsend them to people who send their programs to you or to \npersonal contacts who are already working on the web, \nbecause they know these programs work and they are already \nbelievers in the system! Besides, this program is \nMUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already \nin \nanother program, stay with it, but do\nyourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! \n\nIt's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long \nbefore others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE \nperson a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET \nWHEN \nYOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have \na \nPayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 \nGIFT \nto\nthe person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list \nat No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow \nthe simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 \nin your bank account!\n\nBecause of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT \nPOTENTIAL, \nthis program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 \ntransaction that you get from PayPal!!!\n\nFollow These Simple Instructions: \n\nE-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST \nname on the list (No.1) along with a note saying \n\"subscribe me to your mailing list\". Only the first \nperson on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. \n\nEdit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the \nother \ntwo names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first \nplace \nin order to earn money fast! \nIf you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-\nmail to then your name will be immediately removed\nfrom the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if \nyou add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of \npeople receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! \n\nNOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in \nthe body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. \nSend out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.\n\nALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the \nresponse \ntime is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! \n\nConsider this! Millions of people surf the Internet\neveryday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people \nto start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move \nthe other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own \ne-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is \nassociated \nwith your PayPal account.\n\n*************************************\n\n1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com\n\n2.  tomk4@prodigy.net\n\n3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com \n\n*************************************\n\nThere are fifty thousand new people who get on the\nInternet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses \nis the people who send you offers by email.\nThe source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to\nthink of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I \nsay 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's \nso easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!\nTo send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE\nand paste it in the message of your E-mail. \n\nTO DO THIS:\n1. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and \"select all\"\n2. Go in your toolbar to \"edit\" and select \"copy\"\n3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure\nit's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)\n4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box\n5. Go to \"edit\" and \"paste\" (Then you can format it\nanyway you want!)\n\n\nNow you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the\ntop name, adding your name and address to the bottom \nof the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, \nYOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT \nforget \nto send $5.00 via PayPal (along \nwith your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL\naddress before deleting it!\n\nNOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in\nthis e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal \nreferring URL;\n\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\n\nTHERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.\nWhen your name reaches the first position in a few\ndays, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!\nThe money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people\nlike yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to \nreceive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a \ntotal of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) \nin two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is \nreal money that you can spend on anything you wish!\nJust deposit it to your own bank account or spend it \ndirectly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that \neasy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?\n\nGO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4\nTHOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?\n\nIF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF\nCOURSE YOU CAN---\n\nThis plan is structured for everyone to send only 20\nletters each. However, you are certainly not limited \nto 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters \nyou send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can \nE-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! \nTHE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run \nthis \nprogram, just follow steps 1\nthrough 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! \nSimple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no \nmailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the \nprinter or copier, and you can do it again and again \nwith your regular groups or gift givers, or start up \na new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the \nlist. This is proof that you paid to get put on the \nlist which is the service rendered to make all this \nlegal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive \nan MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will \nclimb to the number one position at dizzying rates. \nFollow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE \nPLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. \nYour name must run the full gamut on the list to produce \nthe end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list \nWILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats \nthe other people who have worked hard and have earned the \nright to be there. So please, play by the rules and the \n$$$ will come to you!\n$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will \nprosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, \nespecially with all the different programs out there \non the web, but if you don't try this you will \nnever know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!\nI've been watching this type of program for years and\nthis is about as easy and fast as you can get it and \nit can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, \nno envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort \nand faith!!! This program really \"Keeps It Short and Simple\"! \n\nOH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link \nunder your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...\nso they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when \nsomeone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! \nLet's all make some serious money \n$$$$$$\n\nCLICK HERE TO BEGIN:\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\nPlay by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your\ntime, and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS.\n\n\nFOLLOWING ARE SOME NOTES ABOUT PayPal WHICH YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL:PayPal \nlets \nyou pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online \npayment \nservice - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands \nand \nthousands of online shops. You can also use PayPal to \npay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to \nsplit the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in \ncollege,or \nsend cash to someone in another country. Better yet, you can also \nearn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and \ncompletes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! \nWhen \nyou send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your \ncredit \ncard or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, \nbecause \nPayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with \nPayPal \nis more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to \na \nstranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use \nPayPal \nto move money.\nSigning up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only\na couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus \nrequirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your \naccount balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the \nweb site at\n\nhttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com\n\n\"Best of the Web\" -Forbes\n\"Using the service is actually safer than a check or\nmoney order\"- Wall Street Journal\n\n\n\"PayPal can play a major role in your life. You can\nuse it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle \ndinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to \nrepay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- Time\n\n\nPS. Does this sound too good? Well maybe to some skeptics it\nis. But it actually works, and is worth \nthe few minutes of your time now. \nP.S.S.

I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!\nse, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?\n\nSincerely,\n\nRJ\n\nLocation: Midwest, U.S.A.\n\nThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.\n\n-- Frankie R.\n\nLocation: West Coast, USA\n\nIm a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!  \n\n-- A.J.\n\nLocation: United Kingdom\n========================================================\nFinally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive.

You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend\nto work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day\nactivities and it's soon forgotten.\n\nThe program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.\n\nAnyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my \nsponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 \nPAID members in my group!\n\n As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I \nhave more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I had\nnever promoted?\n\nI took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking \nfor confirmation that these were paid members and not just free \nsign-ups...like me :)\n\nWell, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This \nis a program that I had never worked!\n\n All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end \nof the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000\n people.\n\n You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!\n\nI can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program,\n I would have become an active paid member months ago!\n\n With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.\nMy sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every\nmonth...on time.\n\nHow would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check\nout this opportunity and watch your group grow?\n\nTo grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.com\nand write this phrase:\n\n\"Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities\"\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\n\nOnce I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you \nwill receive an e-mail titled \"your name, Activate Your FREE Membership Today!\" You will then need to confirm your FREE Membership.\nWe will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.\n\nThat's all there is to it.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSean\n\n P.S. After having several negative experiences with network\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\nThis company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\nand finally make real money on the internet.\n\nDon't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\nprogram for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free\nmembership.\n\n \n============================================================================\n\n=========\n\"This email is sent in compliance with strict anti-abuse and NO SPAM\nregulations.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>\nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\n\n<BR>\nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>\nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>\nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>\n<BR>\n&quot;In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>\ndime.&quot;<BR>\n<BR>\nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>\nproportions.

For every Judgment that is paid, 5more<BR>\nJudgments take its place.<BR>\n<BR>\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>\ntechniques necessary to succeed.<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>\nprocessing of Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession.</FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"><B>We<BR>\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>\nyear.

Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>\nare women and 36% are part time .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>\n<BR>\nQuote's from several of our students:<BR>\n<BR>\nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop<BR>\nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\">My<BR>\nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT></FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> .Your<BR>\nprofessionalism in both the manual and your support.  <BR>\nYou have the video opened doors for me in the future. <BR>\nThere's no stopping me now.

I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. \n\nMy colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. \n\nIn order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !\nand members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.\nWe have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.\n\nWe wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We\nIntend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. \nPlease acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.\nIt was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBEN KOKORI",

I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>\nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\n<BR>\nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>\nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>\nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>\n<BR>\n&quot;In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>\ndime.&quot;<BR>\n<BR>\nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>\nproportions.

For every Judgment that is paid, 5more<BR>\nJudgments take its place.<BR>\n<BR>\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>\ntechniques necessary to succeed.<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>\nprocessing of Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession.</FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"><B>We<BR>\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>\nand $100,000.00 per year</FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\">.</B> Some choose to operateout of<BR>\ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>\nare women and 36% are part time .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>\n<BR>\nQuote's from several of our students:<BR>\n<BR>\nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop<BR>\nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffff00\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\">My<BR>\nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT></FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#0000ff\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" style=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\" LANG=\"0\"> .Your<BR>\nprofessionalism in both the manual and your support.  <BR>\nYou have the video opened doors for me in the future. <BR>\nThere's no stopping me now.
